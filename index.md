<biblia:bibleverse theme="header" resource="godsword" width="500" reference="Ps139"><blockquote style="width:500px;">For the choir director; a psalm by David.

      O LORD, you have examined me, and you know me.
         You alone know when I sit down and when I get up.
         You read my thoughts from far away.
         You watch me when I travel and when I rest.
         You are familiar with all my ways.
           Even before there is a ⌊single⌋ word on my tongue,
             you know all about it, LORD.
         You are all around me—in front of me and in back of me.
         You lay your hand on me.
           Such knowledge is beyond my grasp.
           It is so high I cannot reach it.

      Where can I go ⌊to get away⌋ from your Spirit?
      Where can I run ⌊to get away⌋ from you?
         If I go up to heaven, you are there.
         If I make my bed in hell, you are there.
         If I climb upward on the rays of the morning sun
           ⌊or⌋ land on the most distant shore of the sea where the sun sets,
             even there your hand would guide me
               and your right hand would hold on to me.
         If I say, "Let the darkness hide me
           and let the light around me turn into night,"
             even the darkness is not too dark for you.
               Night is as bright as day.
               Darkness and light are the same ⌊to you⌋.

      You alone created my inner being.
      You knitted me together inside my mother.
      I will give thanks to you
         because I have been so amazingly and miraculously made.
           Your works are miraculous, and my soul is fully aware of this.
      My bones were not hidden from you
         when I was being made in secret,
         when I was being skillfully woven in an underground workshop.
      Your eyes saw me when I was only a fetus.
         Every day ⌊of my life⌋ was recorded in your book
           before one of them had taken place.
      How precious are your thoughts concerning me, O God!
      How vast in number they are!
         If I try to count them,
           there would be more of them than there are grains of sand.
             When I wake up, I am still with you.

      I wish that you would kill wicked people, O God,
         and that bloodthirsty people would leave me alone.
           They say wicked things about you.
           Your enemies misuse your name.
      Shouldn't I hate those who hate you, O LORD?
      Shouldn't I be disgusted with those who attack you?
         I hate them with all my heart.
           They have become my enemies.

      Examine me, O God, and know my mind.
      Test me, and know my thoughts.
         See whether I am on an evil path.
           Then lead me on the everlasting path. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "https://biblia.com/bible/godsword/Ps139">Ps 139</a></blockquote></biblia:bibleverse>
