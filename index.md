<biblia:bibleverse theme="header" resource="ylt" width="500" reference="Eph3.1-21"><blockquote style="width:500px;">For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations, if, indeed, ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you, that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few words— in regard to which ye are able, reading it, to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit— that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news, of which I became a ministrant, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power; to me—the less than the least of all the saints—was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news—the untraceable riches of the Christ, and to cause all to see what is the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God, who the all things did create by Jesus Christ, that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly places, through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God, according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him, wherefore, I ask you not to faint in my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named, that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might to be strengthened through His Spirit, in regard to the inner man, that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded, that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled—to all the fulness of God; and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us, to Him is the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "https://biblia.com/bible/ylt/Eph3.1-21">Eph 3:1-21</a></blockquote></biblia:bibleverse>

<biblia:bibleverse theme="header" resource="godsword" width="500" reference="Ps139"><blockquote style="width:500px;">For the choir director; a psalm by David.

      O LORD, you have examined me, and you know me.
         You alone know when I sit down and when I get up.
         You read my thoughts from far away.
         You watch me when I travel and when I rest.
         You are familiar with all my ways.
           Even before there is a ⌊single⌋ word on my tongue,
             you know all about it, LORD.
         You are all around me—in front of me and in back of me.
         You lay your hand on me.
           Such knowledge is beyond my grasp.
           It is so high I cannot reach it.

      Where can I go ⌊to get away⌋ from your Spirit?
      Where can I run ⌊to get away⌋ from you?
         If I go up to heaven, you are there.
         If I make my bed in hell, you are there.
         If I climb upward on the rays of the morning sun
           ⌊or⌋ land on the most distant shore of the sea where the sun sets,
             even there your hand would guide me
               and your right hand would hold on to me.
         If I say, "Let the darkness hide me
           and let the light around me turn into night,"
             even the darkness is not too dark for you.
               Night is as bright as day.
               Darkness and light are the same ⌊to you⌋.

      You alone created my inner being.
      You knitted me together inside my mother.
      I will give thanks to you
         because I have been so amazingly and miraculously made.
           Your works are miraculous, and my soul is fully aware of this.
      My bones were not hidden from you
         when I was being made in secret,
         when I was being skillfully woven in an underground workshop.
      Your eyes saw me when I was only a fetus.
         Every day ⌊of my life⌋ was recorded in your book
           before one of them had taken place.
      How precious are your thoughts concerning me, O God!
      How vast in number they are!
         If I try to count them,
           there would be more of them than there are grains of sand.
             When I wake up, I am still with you.

      I wish that you would kill wicked people, O God,
         and that bloodthirsty people would leave me alone.
           They say wicked things about you.
           Your enemies misuse your name.
      Shouldn't I hate those who hate you, O LORD?
      Shouldn't I be disgusted with those who attack you?
         I hate them with all my heart.
           They have become my enemies.

      Examine me, O God, and know my mind.
      Test me, and know my thoughts.
         See whether I am on an evil path.
           Then lead me on the everlasting path. &mdash; <a target="_blank" href = "https://biblia.com/bible/godsword/Ps139">Ps 139</a></blockquote></biblia:bibleverse>
